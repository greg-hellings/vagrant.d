Vagrantfile
==========

This directory is primarily concerned with containing a single Vagrantfile that
can be used to reliably configure and re-configure a Vagrant environment set of
VMs.

Usage
=====

This entire repository can be checked out as your user's ~/.vagrant.d/
directory, and then the Vagrantfile will be merged with ones in your
development environment. Alternatively, if you would rather, you can download
just the Vagrantfile itself to your local ~/.vagrant.d/ folder.

For questions about using the functions herein, check the code in the
Vagrantfile itself.
